Challenges :

1. In our application explicit/implicit wait is not working as application is not stable, chances of failing is more, so we
implemented re try - catch block, where it will wait until page loads or element is visible
 
(Wait will not work, explicit/implicit wait is not working it is depending on applicationre/try catch)

2. Some times buttons in the application should click, but it wont click some time, so we used re try-catch block
to find the element in the next page

(Some times buttons are clicked/not clicked, but in my script it is not throwing any exception - re/try catch block, next page validate some thing)

3. We have hyCharts in our application, elements are not directly visible if we use findElement
So, we should use findelement.finelements - like from root to child we need to traverse. 
(hicharts automation - use findelement.findelemennts)

4. jenkins - actions class is not working so we are using moveToElement()
5. In iOS and windows application, when we integrate the code and run scripts will fail due to non - visibility of element.
So, we used scrollIntoView(), a javascript executor to move to element.

ScrollIntoView() is mainly used when we automate the hiCharts in our application

5. As application is not stable, Most of the time we are getting synchronization issue - Usually timeOutExceptions
We used re try/catch block to overcome the issue

synchronisation issues - timeOutexception - explicit wait - 



Our application is not stable
In our reusable class re try/catch is implemented in our reusable methods
