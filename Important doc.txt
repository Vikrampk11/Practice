Appium Xcode

Open the project, click on Edscockpit.xcworkspace file, it will open the Xcode

First we need to build the app in the sense click on run button, it will open the iPhone

Select the project and click on run, it will open the app in mentioned iPhone 


After 9.3, iOS version, we have XCUITest will be used.



Start the Appium server
Click on search icon,
Select automatic servers
Enter desired capabilities
Save it

Other method where we cannot find page elements : 
Like(Popups) back, login, bookofwork, cancel etc

Go to xcode, 

Xcode->Open Developer Tool->Accessibility Inspector

Click on focus icon and focus where ever its needed.

Data in label section can be taken as By.name(“data”);


If we get exception like Facebook: 

It is due to compatibility phone compatibility issue
Generate app for phone specific and run it through that phone, it helps

Types of Output of an API
Output of API could be
1.	Any type of data
2.	Status (say Pass or Fail)
3.	Call to another API function.

Types of Bugs that API testing detects
•	Fails to handle error conditions gracefully
•	Unused flags
•	Missing or duplicate functionality
•	Reliability Issues. Difficulty in connecting and getting a response from API.
•	Security Issues
•	Multi-threading issues
•	Performance Issues. API response time is very high.
•	Improper errors/warning to caller
•	Incorrect handling of valid argument values
•	Response Data is not structured correctly (JSON or XML)

Tools for API testing
Since API and Unit Testing both target source code, similar tools can be used for testing both.
•	SOAPUI - It's an easy-to-use tool with extensive REST and SOAP API testing capabilities – no scripting experience is required.
•	Postman with jetpacks

Challenges of API Testing
Challenges of API testing includes:
•	Main challenges in API testing is Parameter Combination, Parameter Selection, and Call Sequencing
•	There is no GUI available to test the application which makes difficult to give input values
•	Validating and Verifying the output in different system is little difficult for testers
•	Parameters selection and categorization is required to be known to the testers
•	Exception handling function needs to be tested
•	Coding knowledge is necessary for testers

HTTP Status Codes

1xx: Informational	Communicates transfer protocol-level information.
2xx: Success	Indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.
3xx: Redirection	Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.
4xx: Client Error	This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.
5xx: Server Error	The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.

How to pass parameters :
1.	Header - Pass through URL
2.	Body - Inside json format, there we can specify the parameters


SOAP UI Tool,   (wsdl=web serve definition language, which contains the data in xml format)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XolvQaeRglk

****At a time we can send only one request

What ever developer has created, we just need to create a project
1 interface will be created with n number of methods inside
For each and every method we have one request

//URL for the same should be copied with in URL tab

If we click on a request, a xml code will open in request tab,
Usually ‘?’ symbol Will be there in the request. If we want to search for a particular record, remove ‘?’ symbol mark and enter particular string, 

If we run the same, for the request, we will get the specific response in soap format which developer wrote the code with all the details according to specification


To Create a SOAP project : 
Copy the ?wsdl link(Usually it will be provided by the developer)

File->Create new SOAP project

In Initial WSDL, copy the ?wsdl link
It will automatically populate the name in Project Name section.
We can edit our project name.

Select CreateRequests check box, which will create a sample requests for all operations
Click OK.

It will create a project.
If we enlarge the project, 2 info interface will be created.
1 is actual and another one is duplicate with the name ending with 12
If we open the first one, it will contain the methods wrt the wsdl file

To give security, SOAP has (In request)

Soapenv: Envelope 
Soapenv: header
Soapenv: body 

Will be provided, so that no one can hack it

In response, it will give soap based xml file
Where it contains
soap: Envelope
Soap:body
<responce tag>
<actual response>


How to write a test case for SOAP UI

Say for example, for a foot ball team, how Many are there from Brazil?
Or, if we pass data as 123 or some special charecters, if it is giving random response for the foot ball team, definitely its a defect, it should handle these type of situations as well.

To Create, 
First we need to create a test suite
Go the that project, right click->Create Test Suite
Enter the testSuite name, click OK

Now a package has been created for the same.
Right click on the testSuite package, select new test case
Give appropriate name, click ok

If open the test case, we will have 3 thins inside
1.	Test Steps
2.	Load Tests
3.	Security Tests

Our scope is test steps.
Load and security, separate testers will do

Right click on TestStep->Test Request
Give name as ex: allPlayerRequest,
Then it will give the list of functions available 
Select appropriate method name
Click ok
Click ok

Now we got the request
If we run the same, it will give the response for the same

Like this, we can create n number of test cases

****Interview question
How to create a project structure

Project -TestSuite 1-TestCase1-TestRequest1,TestRequest2…
                                                                TestCase2-TestRequest1,TestRequest2…

                                TestSuite 2-TestCase1-TestRequest1,TestRequest2…
                                                                TestCase2-TestRequest1,TestRequest2…

                                TestSuite 3-TestCase1-TestRequest1,TestRequest2…
                                                                TestCase2-TestRequest1,TestRequest2…
 And so on

Download the ReadyAPI or SoapUI Pro version 2.3.0(Latest version) 
Opensource version is 5.4.0

If we are not able to create a test suite or other things, on the top, select SOAPUI NG, it will work

FInally, if we save the project, it will be saved as xml file

App automation using selenium  -  Appium

Advantages : 
Open Source
Can do user acceptance testing

Disadvantages of Appium : 
Versions are not stable
As of now we are using 1.7.1 appium version
Developer support is not there(24*7, support is not there)
Initial setup will take more time

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28363221/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-appium 

Native App :

App which is written in 
Android - Java, android SDK’s
IOS - Swift language, Objective C

Hybrid App :
HTML - Structure of the page
CSS - Styles, color codes, border
JS

Phone GAP(One of the famous IDE) is the IDE, where they will use to design an Application in IOS for web application
For native, Xcode



Hybrid app, will work with the help of internet connection
Difference between native and hybrid application
1.	Language we are using native and hybrid
2.	Internet connection is not always required in native app, but must needed for Hybrid (Navigate to web or 3rd party application)

Native Apps has 2 types
Proprieteriship and Thirdparty application
Proprieteriship - Message, Call
Thirdparty application - Developed by third party people

If we get the access in IOS, then only we can automate application
As our applications are in development phase, we can easily moveahead, as access is enabled

If we wanted to automate other apps in IOS, may be we can use developed ID and automate the same
(Check Once)


How to run the application in real devices in both IOS and Android devices

Architecture of Appium : 

IDE(POM)
Appium Libraries(Jars) —(JSON)— Appim server ——  View (Android :UI Automator)  — Devices
(Triggering Point)                                                                 

Architecture in Appium
Why JSON is used in Appium server?


App package : Package of the whole application
App Activity : When we open an application, which page has to come first(We need to select mail activity)

APK info - will list all the apps the device.
If we wanted to get the app details, we can long press and get the data



Inspectors :
1.	UI Automator Viewer —  Native (Android)
2.	Appium Inspector — Native (Android and iOS)
3.	Chrome Browser — (Hybrid / Mobile Web).          ————— Chrome://Inspect
4.	Maccacaw Inspector. —— Native (Android and iOS)
5.	Accesibility Inspector —Only for iOS,  (Native for sure)Check where we can use this inspector

Automation of Rest API using Rest Assured framework

It is an open source Java Domain Specific Language
Rest Assured is built on top of http client
Supports both XML and JSON

It supports all the below requests:
POST
GET
PUT
DELETE
OPTIONS
PATCH
HEAD

GET WILL GET THE DATA,
AND OTHERS WILL MAKE CHANGES RESOURCE ON THE SERVER

Preconditions needed for Rest Assured
Java, Eclipse, Maven, TestNG

http://rest-assured.io/, get the dependencies need for restAssured framework

Fake API, useful to play with resources

Doc on RestAPIs
https://www.hascode.com/

GET, DELETE, PUT will not create any load on server while making multiple calls
Post can create load on server if made multiple calls

POST perform the changes to server, post always creates resource in server
Ex : Uploading the picture, sending tweet

DELETE method will delete the data or resources from the server
Ex : Deleting the photos, deleting any file

PUT : Used to edit or update the resource (It will not create)
Ex : Editing the resource

To create a dummy JSON data in localhost
